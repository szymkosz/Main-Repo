Let's pretend that I am writing a story.

This is the main part of my story and I want to save it.

Let's continue our experiment. Let's pretend that I just thought of something new. A new idea, let's say.
But I don't want to lose the initial work and train of thought I had. So I created a branch on Git and now I am
continuing on my new tangent. Fine. Tangent is done. I want to see how Git handles me switching branches.

So Git will actively just change my open files. Live. That's cool.

But

It's not enough for me. What if after I have branched, I want to keep both branches without merging yet?

How will it handle that?

So far I can't tell if Git pushed both branches to Github. It seems my new branch is only stored locally.
That is fine, I guess. My next bit of curiosity lies with finding out what happens when I close files and Terminal.
Will I lose my progress on anything?

Update: everything is still here. Cool. This is all still on my second branch. My file on the master branch is still empty.
I'm going to now merge my branches.
