Let's pretend that I am writing a story.

This is the main part of my story and I want to save it.

Let's continue our experiment. Let's pretend that I just thought of something new. A new idea, let's say.
But I don't want to lose the initial work and train of thought I had. So I created a branch on Git and now I am
continuing on my new tangent. Fine. Tangent is done. I want to see how Git handles me switching branches.
